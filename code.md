I used to code a lot in Matlab and developped [Statlearn][statlearn], a complete suite of Statistical Learning functions inculing multivariate 
density distributions, optimization algorithms, model selection, etc. Although quite complete, this toolbox in no more maintained as 
I switched to Python, Scala and Lua.

Hopefully, I'm going to participate in the development of [Wolfe][wolfe]
