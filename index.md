My name is Guillaume Bouchard <a class="fnote" href="#fnote-name">*</a>,
I am senior researcher at [University College London][ucl] (UCL) and find
research on [Natural Language Processing][nlp] (NLP) and [Machine Learning][ml]
to be fascinating. I'm deeply interested in one research direction: replacing programming languages 
by interactive dialog interaction in natural language. We currently created a company called [Bloomsbury-AI][bai] with colleagues to
make this project real.

If you share any of my research interests, do have a look at
my [list of publications][pubs] and if you have questions regarding
my previous and/or current research, feel free to [contact me][contact].
I am currently a member of the [UCL Machine Reading Group][uclmr]
at the [Department of Computer Science][uclcs] and received a PhD in 2004
